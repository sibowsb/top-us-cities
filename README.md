# top-us-cities

This project visualizes the population of top US cities. It is my final project submission for `CS 498 Data Visualization` at UIUC.

The [data source](https://gist.github.com/Miserlou/11500b2345d3fe850c92) is publicly available on GitHub.
The city geolocations are provided by `[simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities)`.
